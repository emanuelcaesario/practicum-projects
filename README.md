# Vehicle Price Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to showcase my skills in exploratory data analysis following my participation in Sprint 3 of the data scientist course at Practicum Indonesia.

The objective of this project is to analyze the factors influencing the selling price of cars in the used vehicle market. I have been provided with a dataset containing tens of thousands of vehicle advertisements from the Crankshaft List website.

## Data Description

We have obtained the `vehicles_us.csv` dataset, which consists of the following columns:

- `price`: the selling price of the vehicle
- `model_year`: the year the vehicle was manufactured
- `model`: the type of vehicle
- `condition`: the condition of the vehicle
- `cylinders`: the type or number of cylinders in the vehicle
- `fuel`: the type of fuel used (e.g., gas, diesel)
- `odometer`: the mileage of the vehicle when the ad was displayed
- `transmission`: the type of transmission in the vehicle
- `paint_color`: the color of the vehicle
- `is_4wd`: a Boolean value indicating whether the vehicle has 4-wheel drive
- `date_posted`: the date the ad was displayed
- `days_listed`: the duration in days for which the ad was active until it was removed


## Stages

The project consists of three main stages:

### Stage 1: Data Pre-processing:
In this stage, I focused on improving data quality by addressing missing values, adjusting data types, and adding relevant columns.

### Stage 2: Exploratory Data Analysis:
This is the core part of the project, involving the analysis of the dataset to uncover insights and address the given tasks. I examined key parameters, handled outliers, conducted visualizations, and performed data analysis and interpretation.

### Stage 3: Conclusion:
In this section, I present the overall conclusions based on the analysis conducted, along with recommendations on the factors that should be given more attention when determining the selling price of a used vehicle.

By following these stages, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in exploratory data analysis and provide valuable insights into the factors influencing the selling price of used vehicles. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
